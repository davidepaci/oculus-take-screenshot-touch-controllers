# oculus-take-screenshot-touch-controllers
This is an old AutoHotKey script I made in 2018/2019 for the Virtual Reality Discord. Made for Rift CV1.

It allows you to take screenshots while in VR by holding both Trigger buttons and pressing the Thumbsticks. Oculus added a screenshot button a few months after this script, so there's no need for this anymore

## How To Set Up
- Install AHK (AutoHotKey) <- You're probably already here!
- Right-click 'oculus-mirror-take-screenshot.ahk' and click on Edit Script
- Edit the global variables at the top with your Oculus folder path and where you want your screenshots to be saved.
- Save 
- Right-click 'oculus-mirror-take-screenshot.ahk' and click on Compile Script

## How To Run
Simply run the compiled file everytime you need it.

## Usage
Simply pull both Trigger buttons then swiftly press the Thumbsticks and release again. Pictures are saved as PNG.

## How To Close
Tray > 'H' icon > Exit/Pause Script
